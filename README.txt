The goal is to get all the positions to off ("_"). The grid is indexed from 1-25:
1   2  3  4  5
6   7  8  9 10
11 12 13 14 15
16 17 18 19 20
21 22 23 24 25

Choosing an index toggles that index and all adjacent indices above,below,left, and right, if existent.
-1 shows a hint, i.e. one selection towards the solution.
-25 shows all selections towards the solution.
